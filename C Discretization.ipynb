    "## Discretization\n",
    "Discretization is converting numeric (continuous) attributes to be discrete (categorical). Here are a few reasons you might apply discretization:\n",
    "* To create frequency diagrams\n",
    "* To look at relationships (e.g., to another discrete attribute)\n",
    "* To remove \"noise\"\n",
    "* To use with specific mining algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach: Partition the values into disjoint consecutive subranges (bins)\n",
    "* Each bin (or bucket) denotes a category (ordinal)\n",
    "* The range of each bin is the width\n",
    "* Note that for n bins, we assume there are n cutoff points\n",
    "    * Includes max value (as last cutoff)\n",
    "    * All bins are are half-open. For example, if the cutoffs are \\[1, 2, 3, 4\\] then the first bin is (-inf, 1\\] and the second (1, 2\\] and the third (2, 3\\] and the last (3, 4\\]\n",
    "* Alternatively we could assume other conventions, such as\n",
    "    * n - 1 cutoffs and not include max as last cutoff\n",
    "    * n + 1 cutoffs (including the min and max value) which is the approach that numpy's [histogram()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html#numpy.histogram) function uses\n",
    "        * All but the last (righthand-most) bin is half-open. For example, if the cutoffs are \\[1, 2, 3, 4\\] then the first bin is \\[1, 2) and the second \\[2, 3). The last bin, however, is \\[3, 4\\]\n",
